# Puppy Paradise
This project is a sample usage of my [AOModalStatusView framework](https://github.com/alecdoconnor/AOModalStatusView).
When running, this application will show pictures of puppies and provide you the option to save the image.
The application does not actaully download the images nor does it shuffle multiple pictures, but will demonstrate the AOModalStatusView in action.
The AOModalStatusView will activate when the SAVE option is tapped.
